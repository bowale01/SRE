# Applying site reliability engineering principles to a service
   
Balance change, velocity, and reliability of the service:

Discover SLIs (e.g., availability, latency)

	
Define SLOs and understand SLAs

Agree to consequences of not meeting the error budget

Construct feedback loops to decide what to build next

Eliminate toil via automation


Manage service life cycle:

	
Manage a service (e.g., introduce a new service, deploy, maintain, and retire it)

Plan for capacity (e.g., quotas and limits management)

Ensure healthy communication and collaboration for operations:



	
Prevent burnout (e.g., set up automation processes to prevent burnout)


Foster a learning culture

Foster a culture of blamelessness
