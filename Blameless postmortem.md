# What is a postmortem?

A postmortem is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.

The outcomes of a postmortem are various and are summarised in the Blameless Postmortem report, which is a detailed document outlining the key events of the incident, together with key information to understand and learn.  
There are templates from Google https://sre.google/sre-book/example-postmortem/,  Atlassian https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/postmortem/templates#incident-summary,  PageDuty https://response.pagerduty.com/after/post_mortem_template/, and others https://github.com/dastergon/postmortem-templates and some real examples from Twilio https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/billing-incident-post-mortem-breakdown-analysis-and-root-cause-html, Spotify https://engineering.atspotify.com/2013/06/incident-management-at-spotify/, and others https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems

Usual Parts of a postmortem report:
Impact

Root cause

Triggering event

Timeline

The resolution


Factual Information / Quantifiable metrics / Supporting information

Action items

Lessons learned


# Why?
Blameless postmortems are a great tool to reflect and learn what things are working well, and what can be improved, or changed, in order to make things better for the future. They have a similar purpose of retrospectives in agile methodologies.  

# When?
Anytime an SLO is breached.

Anytime there's an incident that requires an immediate/emergency response, some companies make them mandatory for high-severity incidents.

Anytime other team has been impacted

Good Practices

Schedule a postmortem meeting within the next <7 days 

Commit, or make a policy, to write a draft and publish the blameless postmortem report within X hours of the event.

Commit, or make a policy, to complete  and publish the report within X business days

Do's and don'ts   https://response.pagerduty.com/after/effective_post_mortems/

Avoid pointing fingers, focus on the root causes of an incident not on accumulating pieces of evidence to accuse a particular person or team, or their actions or behaviours for a result.
