# CI/CD Pipelines

#### Key Practices:
Automate pipelines to ensure fast, reliable deployments.

Include automated tests (unit, integration, regression) in the pipeline.

Use Launchpad CI/CD Template or a similar cookie-cutter to standardize workflows.

#### GitHub PR Process:
Define branch naming conventions (feature/*, bugfix/*).

Code review standards (e.g., minimum two reviewers, specific checklists).

#### Rollbacks:
Automate rollback strategies (e.g., Blue-Green or Canary deployments).

Maintain clear tagging of production-ready releases.

#### Tools:
Use GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD to enforce workflows.
