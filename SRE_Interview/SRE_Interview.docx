# UNIX questions:
Can you describe the difference between hard and soft links?
soft link is an actual link or shortcut to the original file. Can link to directories or remote files. Deleting the original file makes the link useless. Deleting the link does nothing to original file. 
hard link is a mirror copy of the original file i.e. creates another file with a link to the same underlying inode. Can't link to directories. Preserves the contents of the file. Even if you delete the original file, the hard link will still have the data of the original file. Deleting the link does nothing to original file.

What is an inode?
The inode is a data structure in a Unix-style file system which describes a filesystem object such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block location(s) of the objectâ€™s data including times of last change, access, modification, as well as owner and permission data. 

How would you get the log output for a given process?
You can access the output via the proc filesystem i.e. tail -f /proc/<pid>/fd/1 where 1 = stdout, 2 = stderr
strace using process ID
examples of error redirection
Redirect stdout to one file and stderr to another file:

command > out 2>error
Redirect stdout to a file (>out), and then redirect stderr to stdout (2>&1):

command >out 2>&1
Redirect both to a file (this isn't supported by all shells, bash and zsh support it, for example, but sh and ksh do not):

command &> out
